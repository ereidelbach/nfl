Adams was an all-state pick as a senior (1,623 yards, 25 touchdowns, 7.8 yards per carry), coming off a junior year where he was limited by a torn ACL. He was the backup to 2016 third-round pick C.J. Prosise as a true freshman, starting three of 13 games played, covering 835 yards and scoring six times on 117 carries (his 7.1-yard average would have ranked fourth in the country if he had enough carries to qualify). He made a name for himself with a 98-yard run against Wake Forest (longest play from scrimmage in Notre Dame) and 168 yards against Stanford in the rivalry game, scoring on a 62-yard run and setting Notre Dame's freshman single-game rushing record. Adams started nine of 12 games as a sophomore, both sidestepping to find holes and bulling through second-level defenders to lead the Irish with 933 yards (5.9 per attempt) and five scores. He also contributed as a receiver, catching 21 passes for 193 yards and a score. Adams' junior season made him a national name, as he started all 13 games for the Irish, finishing among the nation's leaders with 1,430 yards and scoring nine times on 206 carries (13 receptions, 101 yards).

He signed with Reedley Community College in California for the 2014 season, throwing for 26 touchdowns and 285 yards a game (with 66 rushing yards per contest) in his lone season there. Wyoming head coach Craig Bohl saw Allen's talent, wondering if he could be another Carson Wentz, the number two overall pick for the Philadelphia Eagles who he recruited and coached at North Dakota State before moving to Laramie. Allen only got a chance to play in two games (4-of-6, 51 yards passing; 3 rushes, 40 yards) for the Cowboys in 2015, starting once, before breaking his right clavicle and taking a medical redshirt. His sophomore season, on the other hand, was healthy and productive. The Cowboys made the Mountain West Conference Championship game with his leadership in 14 starts, completing 56 percent of his passes (209-of-373) throwing for 3,203 yards and 28 touchdowns. That completion percentage and his 15 interceptions showed that his game needs to be tamed, and those concerns were only exacerbated in 2017. Allen was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a junior, but he finished 72nd in the country in passing efficiency by completing just 56.3 percent of his passes (152-of-270) for just 1,812 yards and 16 touchdowns against six interceptions. Allen struggled against Power Five foes Iowa (23-of-40, 174 yards, 2 INT) and Oregon (9-of-24, 64 yards, INT). He missed the last two regular season games with an injury to his throwing shoulder but returned for the Cowboys' bowl win over Central Michigan (11-of-19, 154 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INT).  ",

The father of one (John Jr.) has contributed as a junior, as well, starting nine times in 13 games (22 tackles, 1.5 for loss, two pass breakups) to free up other defenders to make big plays. Atkins started three of 10 games in 2015 (12 tackles, one for loss) and played 10 games as a reserve in 2014 (nine stops). He couldn't meet the needed ACT score to gain entry to Georgia in 2012, so he spent that fall at Hargrave Military Academy, where he played with former Bulldog and first-round pick Leonard Floyd. Atkins worked as a greeter at a local Toyota dealership throughout his time in Athens.",

Averett was going to compete for playing time as a sophomore, but biceps and elbow injuries before the season squashed that hope.

Averett finally got his shot in 2016, starting 13 games and playing in all 15 (48 tackles, three for loss, sack, eight pass breakups). He was picked on regularly but used his toughness to stick with plays. Averett was the team's defensive MVP in their national semifinal win over Washington (eight tackles, sack, forced fumble). He was a starter all 14 games of his senior season, posting 48 stops, four for loss, an interception, and eight pass breakups in 2017. Averett has the athleticism for the position, posting the top long jump mark in high school nationally as a junior (25 feet, two inches) and winning New Jersey state titles in the 55-meter dash and high jump. He got a chance at receiver before his sophomore year, but cornerback is his home for now, and in the future.",

        "overview": "The most impressive number for Joe Thomas Barrett is three: The number of times he was named a team captain for Ohio State. That's the first time it has happened in the school's long history. Barrett only needs six passing or rushing touchdowns in 2017 to break Drew Brees' record of 106 career touchdowns. He actually scored 45 times as a redshirt freshman (he sat out 2013 recovering from a knee injury suffered in high school), which was a Big Ten record. Barrett stepped in for Braxton Miller (lost to injury) to start his first college game and went 11-1 before breaking his ankle against Michigan. He was the Big Ten's Quarterback and Freshman of the Year in 2014, received freshman All-American recognition, and even finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting after putting up 2,834 passing yards and 938 rushing yards. He was also the second-most efficient passer in the country, behind Heisman winner Marcus Mariota (34 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, 64.6 completion percentage). Cardale Jones beat Barrett out for the starting job at the start of the 2015 season, however, as Jones' play taking over for Barrett the previous year led the Buckeyes to a national title. He eventually got back in the starting lineup for five (4-1 record) of the team's final six games (playing in 11 total for the year), completing 63.3 percent of his passes for 992 yards and 11 scores with four interceptions. Barrett also ran for 682 yards and 11 scores on just 115 carries. Barrett earned the starting job back for 2016, leading the team in all 13 games (11-2 record) and again winning the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award and bringing the Buckeyes back to the College Football Playoffs (despite not going to the Big Ten Championship Game). He threw for 2,428 yards and 24 touchdowns against just five interceptions, completing a career-low 61.8 percent of his passes. Barrett also terrorized defenses by running for 847 yards and nine touchdowns. He won his third Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award in 2017, starting all 14 games for the Cotton Bowl-winning, 12-2 Buckeyes, completing 64.7 percent of his passes (240-371) for 3,053 yards, 35 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.",

After a successful high school career at powerhouse Southlake Carroll High School in Texas, he decided to follow his older (by 19 years) brother's footsteps to Lincoln. Coaches didn't wait to see if he could handle the job, as he stepped forward to handle placekicking duties as a true freshman in 2014 (59-of-59 extra points, 14-of-21 field goals, 2-of-7 from 40-plus yards). Drew beat Kris' freshman scoring record with 101 points on the year. He had an honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year in 2015 (44-of-46 extra points, 21-of-27 field goals, 13-of-17 from 40-plus yards out), tying an NCAA record with five field goals in one half, including a 50-yarder (Southern Miss). Brown's junior year came after a tragic car accident where Nebraska punter Sam Foltz passed away (Brown was going to the same destination that night, but was in a different car). He converted 12-of-14 field goal attempts in his junior season (1-of-2 from 50-plus yards) and made all 38 extra point attempts. Brown's statistics were almost exactly the same in his final year with the Cornhuskers, as he made 12-of-14 field goals again (long of 44 yards, no attempts from over 50 yards, one blocked) and all 37 extra point attempts. He also had 28 touchbacks on 60 kickoffs. ",

It took him a while to earn playing time, however, because of the talent in the Nittany Lions' secondary. He started one game as a true freshman, playing in 10 overall (10 tackles, one interception, two pass breakups). Campbell played in eight games as a reserve in 2015 (16 tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks) but missed the final five games due to injury. As a junior, he received more playing time (three starts in 13 games), posting 31 tackles, intercepting one pass and breaking up six. He made six stops and broke up a pass against USC in the Rose Bowl.",

He had a solid junior year, catching 43 passes for a team-high 606 yards and five scores for the Ducks. Carrington's sophomore year started with a six-game suspension for a positive drug test before Oregon's appearance in the prior year's College Football Playoff. He was still named second-team All-Pac 12 in 2015 with 32 receptions for 609 yards and six touchdowns. Carrington had a very good freshman season before the failed test (37 receptions, 704 yards, four touchdowns), putting up big numbers in the Rose Bowl (7 receptions, 165 yards, two touchdowns) which helped the Ducks make the playoffs. The San Diego native was a top-40 receiver recruit nationally and first-team All-Cal Hi pick as a senior quarterback, receiver, and safety. Darren Carrington I played at Northern Arizona and played eight years in the NFL for five teams (two Super Bowl appearances) as a fifth-round pick in 1989.",

He was the Philadelphia Inquirer Defensive Player of the Year as a high school senior, picking off eight passes and returning three for touchdowns. As a freshman, he started all but the opener, making 65 tackles, intercepting one pass (against NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana's son, Nick) and breaking up eight others. Chandler's sophomore season was no disappointment, as he earned second-team All-AAC honors by starting every game, posting 65 stops (5.5 for loss), intercepting four passes (taking back two for scores) and breaking up 10 others. He also impressed as a punt returner (17 returns, 206 yards). He repeated the second-team all-conference accolades in 2016 (51 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions) despite moving from cornerback to free safety. Chandler was named honorable mention All-AAC as a senior, starting all 12 games and finishing with 74 tackles, 1.5 for loss, two interceptions, and three pass breakups (two punt returns for 9 yards).",

He suited up at quarterback for the Hoosiers in 2014, but struggled as a passer (3-of-12, 31 yards, no scores, two interceptions) and then suffered a season-ending ACL injury against Iowa. He moved to linebacker during the following spring, and played in the team's final eight games there (four tackles). Becoming more comfortable at the position, he started once in 13 games played, making 29 stops, three for loss, and two sacks. Covington took another step forward at linebacker in 2017, using his athleticism to garner honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a 12-game starter, posting 85 tackles, 12 for loss, three sacks, and five pass breakups. He was named Indiana's Defensive Player of the Year for his efforts.",

The tall and long-limbed edge defender got stronger throughout his career at UTSA. He played in the first 11 games of his true freshman season with the Roadrunners (missed the finale due to injury), collecting 14 tackles, three of which were sacks. Davenport was voted an honorable mention all-conference performer in 2015, starting 11 games, posting 49 tackles, 7.5 for loss, four sacks, three pass break-ups, and two forced fumbles on the year. Listed as a defensive end, Davenport made plays as a stand-up rusher in his junior season, starting 12 of 13 games played, making 68 tackles, 10 for loss, and a team-best 6.5 sacks and eight quarterback hurries. His 11 tackles, 1.5 for loss and a sack against Texas A&M in 2016 put him on the national radar.",

The tall, lean left-footer used his full extension to earn first-team all-conference honors as a sophomore, as well. He averaged 46 yards per punt gross, with 16 inside the 20 and just four touchbacks. As a redshirt freshman, Davidson had outstanding first season on the field for the Falcons (42.6-yard gross average, 24 inside the 20, three touchbacks).",

Dickerson decided to stay in-state to play for the Bruins to be an hour flight from home rather than across the country. He played in 12 games as a true freshman (one tackle) before becoming a regular contributor the next three seasons. Dickerson started one of 13 games played in 2015, setting career highs with 38 tackles, four for loss, one sack, and four pass breakups. He started eight times in 12 games as a junior (34 stops, 1.5 for loss) and the first seven games in his senior year (21 tackles, one for loss) but missed the rest of the season with a collarbone injury.",

Edmonds set an FCS record by averaging 21.1 yards per carry against Lafayette (17-359, four touchdowns). Unfortunately, leg injuries limited Edmonds to seven starts in 2017 (136-577, five touchdowns rushing; 11-129 receiving) and squashed his hopes of setting the all-time FCS rushing record.

As fitting as his first name is, his last name is even more apt for his NFL future, as it is pronounced EDGE-eh-for. His edge rushing prowess was on full display in 2016, when he showed off a growing frame, closing speed, and a spin move to garner third-team All-ACC from league coaches and media with 50 tackles, 17 for loss, 10.5 sacks, an interception, three pass break-ups and two forced fumbles. He showed glimpses of that talent as a sophomore despite missing the first five games of the year with concussion symptoms. Ejiofor played in seven games that year, leading the team with 4.5 sacks among his 28 stops, 7.5 for loss. As a redshirt freshman, he played in 10 contests (missing the final two games with his first concussion), making 12 tackles and two sacks. ",

Shows an ability to attack one-on-one defenders with accurate fades and back-shoulder throws. Able to work from sideline to sideline with his progressions. Accurate timing throws on deep outs are second nature after years in this offense. Has arm talent to uncork accurate strikes when falling off-balance. Able to slide in all directions inside pocket to buy additional time. Throws very catchable ball that hits receivers in stride. Will look-off high safety out of position to open the middle of the field for a post throw. Throws with plus ball placement.",

Waits too long to cut it loose leading receivers into oncoming traffic. Slow to see blitzers and misses hot routes. Mobility is below average. Sacked 125 times in his career. Pocket poise took downturns at various points during season. Decision making stalls out after getting through early reads. Majority of interceptions came against zone. Nonchalant short touch throws defaulting to back foot releases. Must prove he can win beyond his system. Almost 74 percent of his pass attempts were less than 10 yards.",

Flowers had 22 carries for 115 yards against Iowa State, one of the highlights of a second-team All-Big 12 season where he started 10 of 13 games played and caught 11 passes for 200 yards and four touchdowns. Flowers was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick as a sophomore, playing in 13 games and starting four (eight receptions, 130 yards, four touchdowns). He played in all 13 games, starting five, as a true freshman and nine receptions for 92 yards. Flowers really impressed with his athleticism and toughness as a receiver and rusher in 2017, garnering first-team all-conference notice with 26 receptions for 464 yards and five scores, as well as four goal-line touchdown runs. Flowers' cousin, Tre, is a senior safety at Oklahoma State.",

NFL general managers have to decide whether he has the consistent accuracy from the pocket to lead an NFL offense, but his speed and agility with the ball in his hands and his ability as a playmaker are unquestioned. The four-star recruit and All-Dade County pick as a high school senior (6,042 passing yards, 2,002 rushing yards in his career) signed on to USF because they believed in his ability as a passer. He played in five games as a true freshman, starting once (8-20, 111 yards, two interceptions; 13-73 rushing). Flowers then took over the starting role as a sophomore, leading the USF offense to a school record 5,741 yards of total offense and earning the team's MVP award. He completed 163 of 276 throws (59.1 percent) for 2,296 yards, 22 touchdowns, and eight interceptions while rushing for 991 yards and 12 scores on 191 carries. Flowers excelled as a junior, garnering the American Athletic Conference's Offensive Player of the Year award as a first-team All-Conference pick. He set a school record for rushing yards (1,530) and scores (18) while ranking fourth in the country with 7.7 yards per carry. Flowers also completed 62.5 percent of his passes for 2,807 yards and 24 touchdowns against eight picks. He was the Birmingham Bowl MVP, as well, leading the Bulls to a win over South Carolina (105 rushing yards, three rushing scores, 261 passing yards, two passing touchdowns). While he was relegated to second-team All-Conference in 2017, Flowers still led the school to a 10-2 record and a Birmingham Bowl win over Texas Tech. He started all 12 games (53.1 completion percentage, 2,911 yards, 25 touchdowns passing, six interceptions; 1,078 yards, 11 scores rushing). Flowers lost both of his parents as a youth (father to an accidental shooting, mother to cancer), but is now a father to a young daughter. His stepbrother was also shot and killed just days before he started his first game with the Bulls in 2014.",

His agility belies his size and strength, and his hands are among the best in the country -- despite the fact he is missing the index finger on his left hand because of a birth defect. Having nine fingers didn't make any difference in his second-team All-Big Ten junior campaign, where he caught 47 passes for 580 yards and two scores. Fumagalli was the Cotton Bowl Offensive MVP that year, as well, after catching six throws for 83 yards and a touchdown in the victory over Western Michigan where opposing head coach P.J. Fleck called the young tight end incredible. The Aurora, Illinois native actually walked on at Wisconsin as a three-star recruit for the 2013 season, when he redshirted. Fumagalli played in all 14 games, starting two, as a freshman (14 receptions, 187 yards). He started four times in 11 games played in 2015, upping his totals to 28 receptions, 313 yards, and his first touchdown. Troy's father, Doug, played football at Holy Cross while two brothers played at the University of Dayton.",

The move paid off, as Gallup earned first-team All-Mountain West Conference accolades by catching 76 passes for a conference-high 1,272 yards and 14 scores, working cornerbacks on the sideline, speeding down seams, and going up for the ball with strong hands.

Then the starter's job came in his sophomore season, lining up for all 13 games while being credited with 78 tackles, and a team-leading 10 pass breakups. Harris, an aware corner effective in press and with good ball skills, was a first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference selection in 2016. He started 11 of 12 games and leading the conference with 15 passes defended (two interceptions, 13 breakups) to go along with 55 tackles, 5.5 for loss.

He was an honorable mention All-ACC selection after making 43 stops, 11 for loss, eight sacks, and five forced fumbles (tied for fifth in the FBS) on the year. Hearns' year did not end on a happy note, however, as he was shot in the elbow at an off-campus apartment while celebrating his teammate, Lamar Jackson's winning of the Heisman Trophy. Hearns only started eight of 13 games played in 2017, but still made 42 stops, 13.5 for loss, seven sacks, three pass breakups, and four forced fumbles. His career started off slowly despite being a top 200 prospect nationally, with an injury ending his true freshman season just two games in. Hearns played just two games in his redshirt freshman season, as well, before finally getting a chance as a reserve the following year (12 tackles in 12 games, including three stops in the Music City Bowl).

He started the first nine games of his junior season, intercepting two passes and returning both for touchdowns. Hill also broke up six passes and posted 51 tackles in a season that would have been acknowledged as all-conference team-worthy without the suspension. Hill was an honorable mention All-Big 12 pick in 2015 (49 tackles, one for loss, one interception that was returned for a score), but played in only five games, starting three, during a difficult 2016 season (21 tackles, one pass breakup). Expectations were high for the tall, lean, and athletic Hill coming out of high school as an All-American. He was named the Greater Houston Defensive Player of the Year by the Houston Chronicle and first-team all-state pick after leading the state with 11 interceptions. ",

He spent two years at rookie ball in the Gulf Coast League (hitting .245 at first base in 2014) before trying to get back to football. Hurst walked on for the Gamecocks in the summer of 2015, playing in 12 games as a receiver and tight end, starting once, and making eight catches for 106 yards. He became a star in 2016, starting all 13 games at tight end and setting school records at the position for receptions (48) and yards (616) by consistently nabbing everything thrown his way and outmuscling defenders downfield (he scored one touchdown as well). Hurst was the first sophomore in USC history to be a team captain, albeit as a 23 year-old. The following year, he earned first-team All-SEC recognition by catching 44 passes for 559 yards and two touchdowns. Hurst had Tommy John surgery as an eighth-grader. ",

Jackson played well in his junior season, as well, finishing third in the Heisman voting and earning second-team AP All-American, ACC Offensive Player of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. He completed 59.1 percent of his passes (254-of-430) for 3,660 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (four in the team's bowl loss to Mississippi State). Jackson also ran for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns (both in the top 10 nationally) on 232 carries, while finishing atop the FCS with 405 yards of total offense per game. In his first season with the Cardinals, Jackson started nine of 12 games (once at running back, against Auburn). His performance against Texas A&M in the Music City Bowl at the end of the year portended his future play, as he ran and threw for over 200 yards on his way to Most Valuable Player honors.",

But then he racked up Freshman All-American and third-team All-ACC (league media) honors after an outstanding freshman season where he played in all 13 games, starting the final eight (91 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, five pass break-ups, two forced fumbles). James had 14 stops, two for loss, and a sack against Houston in the 2015 Peach Bowl. James' junior season went about as expected, as he earned second-team AP All-American and first-team All-ACC honors with 84 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, 11 pass break-ups, and a blocked kick. He started 12 games on the year, skipping the Independence Bowl to focus on preparing for the NFL Draft. James' mother nicknamed him Pooh Bear after he was born because he was so hairy and plump.",

Hits all the height, weight, speed marks you want for an early-round safety. Extremely versatile weapon. Can be deployed anywhere on the field on any given snap. Rangy with ability to chase throws from deep middle. Quick to squeeze routes approaching his area of influence. Doesn't just look to hit, he looks for the football once he ranges to the spot. Used in hybrid role near the line of scrimmage. Reliable in his fits and standing up to the run or peeling off and covering tight ends. Savvy blitzer with speed and athleticism to get home. Smooth, loose movement allows for coverage potential against big slots. Careful to leverage ball carriers to the sideline and won't give away an inside cutback. Pursuit strides are fluid and powerful. Solid open-field tackler with reactive athleticism to handle late elusiveness.",

Slow reads lead to slow reactions. Waits a step too late to support over the top and can miss his window for help. Needs better anticipation in coverage. Can be too cautious in run support allowing runners to get up to him rather than taking it to them. Often absorbs contact flat-footed rather than initiating contact. Can improve pursuit angles. Despite his intensity, will still coast on some snaps. Has limited experience. Has played in just 26 college games. Has a torn ACL in his medical history.",

His sophomore season was even better, covering 1,625 yards and scoring 12 times while again garnering first-team all-conference honors (38 carries, 339 yards and four touchdowns rushing). James was also the Hawai'i Bowl MVP despite the Blue Raiders' loss because of his 201 yards of offense (162 receiving, 39 rushing) and 51-yard touchdown. His junior season was cut short in October 2017 because of a broken collarbone (31 receptions, 290 yards, three receiving touchdowns; 10 carries, 57 yards rushing, seven attempts and 37 yards on punt returns), but James still finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.",

It didn't take him long to make an impact on campus, as he led the Aggies with 80 receptions, 1,009 receiving yards, and eight total touchdowns, as well as being their top returner (385 kickoff return yards, 24.4 average on punt returns, two touchdowns). Kirk's combination of a sturdy running back frame, excellent open-field agility, and toughness with the ball in his hands made him a 2016 third-team Associated Press All-American and three-way first-team All-SEC (all-purpose, receiver, return specialist). He started 12 of 13 games as a sophomore, leading the SEC with 83 receptions for 928 yards and nine scores (along with eight rushes for 35 yards). Kirk also led the FBS with three punt return touchdowns (21.7-yard average) on the year. He earned second-team All-SEC honors in 2017, starting all 13 games and leading the Aggies with 71 receptions for 919 yards and 10 touchdowns (including 13 receptions, 189 yards, 3 TD vs Wake Forest in the Belk Bowl). Kirk also received first-team All-American notice by returning eight punts for 175 yards and one touchdown, as well as 21 kickoffs for 480 yards and a score.",

Landry started 12 of 13 games played and received multiple All-American honors as well as first-team All-ACC notice for his play. In a bit of a surprise, Landry returned to use his quickness off the line, change of direction skills, and supreme hustle for B.C. in his senior year instead of going to the NFL.

He started nine games the following year, completing 52 percent of his throws (143-276) for 1,639 yards and 11 touchdowns (he cut the interceptions to seven). Lee transferred from Tulane to Nebraska before the 2016 season, partially because of the beating he took in New Orleans (concussion, shoulder separation, broken finger). He was the Huskers' Scout Team Offensive MVP that year, and then took the reins of the Nebrasks offense in 2017. Lee started all 12 games this fall, completing 57.5 percent of his throws (246-428) for 3,143 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also threw 16 interceptions on the year, however.

Mayfield completed 70.5 percent of his passes (285-of-404), throwing 43 touchdowns against just six interceptions (also rushing for 311 yards and five scores). The Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year led the nation in pass efficiency by a large margin (setting a NCAA record that he himself set the previous year) and yards per pass attempt (11.8), and finished in the top five of pretty much every other passing category. He was an all-state pick from Texas, but his lack of size scared major college programs away. He began his college days in Lubbock, walking on at Texas Tech. In his one and only season there, Mayfield started seven of eight games played, winning Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (218-of-340, 64.1 percent complete, 2,315 yards, 12 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to open up the starting competition, so Mayfield left campus to find a new home. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer student to Oklahoma (eventually, Big 12 coaches approved a rule that gave Mayfield an extra year of eligibility to make up for the lost season, as he was a walk-on that never received a scholarship offer from Tech). Finally on the field as the No. 1 starter in 2015, Mayfield became a second-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting, and was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He also won the Burlsworth Trophy as the nation's top player who began his career as a walk-on after completing 68.1 percent of his passes (269-of-395) for 3,700 yards and 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. In addition to winning Burlsworth Trophy again in 2016, Mayfield was first-team All-Big 12, finished third in Heisman voting, and was a finalist for the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien Awards after leading the FBS in passing efficiency (196.4 rating, ranked first with 70.9 completion percentage, 3,965 yards, 40 touchdowns, eight interceptions). While his completion percentage was aided by horizontal throws, his mobility helped him find secondary targets and his ability to throw passes over the top of defenses also led him to lead the FBS with 11.1 yards per attempt. Mayfield was arrested for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing/resisting arrest in February 2017. He was not suspended for those actions, though he was required to participate in alcohol education classes and community service.  ",

McCloud played in all 14 games of the team's national championship run, starting five contests. He caught 49 passes for 472 yards and two scores, as well as returning 21 punts for 176 yards. As a freshman, McCloud played in 12 games with one start, caught 29 throws for 251 yards and a touchdown, ran seven times for 48 yards, and averaged 31.9 yards on seven kickoff returns. The Tampa native rushed for over 4,000 yards in his final two years in high school but was the second-ranked receiver prospect nationally by Rivals.com.",

After his career as an all-state two-way player in the San Diego area, Meeks was ready to play for the Cardinal right out of the box. He played in 14 games in 2015, starting eight and led the team with three interceptions (including a 66-yard pick six against Iowa in the Rose Bowl) while also posting 34 tackles and four pass breakups. Meeks got the starting nod as a sophomore (11 games), showing off his excellent length, ball skills, and that football knowledge on his way to garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice by recording 22 tackles, two interceptions, and six pass breakups.",

Despite struggling with drops throughout his junior season, Moore ran past, bulled through, and jumped over smaller cornerbacks to get onto the national radar with an SEC-leading 1,012 receiving yards on 62 receptions (eight scores for the season). He did not start against South Carolina because of those drops, but got the call for the last three games of the year and exploded (23 catches for 407 yards and two scores). Moore made 29 catches for 350 yards and three touchdowns as a sophomore starter after making just two catches for 33 yards as a redshirt freshman in 2014. The Texas native was one of the top receiver prospects coming out of the state in 2012 (50 receptions, 1,026 yards, 10 TD as a senior).",

Nickerson bounced back for his sophomore campaign, earning honorable mention All-Conference USA and first-team Freshman All-American honors by starting 11 of 12 games played, compiling 51 tackles, 2.5 for loss, six interceptions (ranking seventh in the FBS), and six pass breakups. Nickerson returned to the starting lineup for all 12 games in 2015, recording 46 stops, 3.5 for loss, and a team-leading eight pass breakups. He earned all-conference recognition once again in 2016 (second team) after intercepting four passes and returning them for 171 yards (ranked fourth in the FBS). Nickerson also deflected nine passes and posted 29 tackles on the year. ",

Patient runner who is extremely effective at running defenders into trouble by setting up his blockers for success before cutting off of their blocks. Uses both subtle and aggressive fakes in space to hinder the tackler's ability to square him up. Arm tacklers won't cut it.

His older cousin, Austin, was Boise State's all-time leading receiver before playing in the NFL for four seasons with the St. Louis Rams. Pettis was an all-conference high school football player at cornerback as a junior and receiver as a senior, while also playing hoops and competing at the California state track meet in the 200 meters and long jump. His athleticism got him on the field with the Huskies as a true freshman in a punt returner (28 att., 288 yards, TD) and part-time starting receiver (five starts in 13 games, 17 receptions, 259 yards, TD) role. Pettis excelled on special teams again as a sophomore, ranking fourth in the nation with 16.9 yards per punt return (16 att., 271 yards, two TD). He started eight of 13 games at receiver, as well (30 receptions, 414 yards, TD). Pettis combined with quarterback Jake Browning to explode on the national scene in 2016, displaying centerfielder-type hands as well as excellent toughness as a receiver, runner, and blocker. He ranked seventh in the FBS with 15 touchdown receptions and garnered second-team All-Pac-12 honors with 53 catches for 822 yards. His increased role on offense did not prevent him from making plays as a punt returner for the third straight season (25 att., 287 yards, two TD, ranked 10th in the FBS with 11.5 yards per return).

Amazingly, he led Stanford in tackles (103, 17 for loss, 7.5 sacks, as well as two forced fumbles) from the interior as a junior in 2017, which led the Associated Press to vote him third-team All-American.

        "overview": "Soccer was Pineiro's first love, but eventually, his talent for kicking the ball through the uprights pushed him into national prominence on the football field. He was a four-time All-Dade County pick in soccer and signed with Florida Atlantic on scholarship. But he did join the Miami Sunset Senior High football team in his senior season, handling extra points and kickoffs. Pineiro didn't make grades for FAU, so he instead signed with ASA College in Miami Beach. He only played soccer his one year at ASA but impressed coaches all over with his leg in kicking camps. Initially, he committed to Alabama but changed his mind to stay closer to home in Gainesville. Pineiro made 21 of 24 field goal attempts in his first year with the Gators (3-of-3 on 50-plus yard attempts), as well as all 32 extra point tries. He also forced touchbacks on 48 of 66 kickoffs. Though Pineiro missed two extra points in 2017, he earned third-team AP All-American and second-team All-SEC notice because he converted 17 of 18 field goal tries, including both his 50-yard attempts. Once again, he sent most of his kickoffs in the end zone for touchbacks (39 of 50). ",

Price earned third-team All-Big Ten honors as an every-week starter at left guard the following year, and then first-team honors on the right side as a junior team captain. He also was named second-team All-American by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Foundation, and other outlets by not only mauling his opponent with excellent upper and lower body strength but also being effective on the move for traps and other run plays. Price won the Remington Trophy as the nation's top center in 2017 and was a unanimous first-team All-American.

Gears down to drop low and secure poor throws and is able to climb up high as well. Touchdown totals could have been doubled with better quarterbacking. Finds open space in scramble situations. Can be lethal after the catch. Uses entire field as his playground. Received almost 33 percent of the team's targets since his freshman year.",

UCLA coaches saw enough of his talent in the spring of 2015 (he graduated from high school one semester early) that they made him the first Bruin freshman opening-weekend starter ever. He won Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and several Freshman All-American honors after setting several school records and completing 60 percent (292-487) of his passes for 3,668  yards and 23 touchdowns (11 interceptions). Despite being only a freshman, he was in command of the offense and used his NFL size and arm to sling the ball all over the field. Rosen's sophomore season had its peaks (400 passing yards against Arizona State) and valleys (three interceptions vs. Texas A&M), and eventually ended with a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder after six starts (59.3 completion percentage, 1,915 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). The surgery to his shoulder was not considered major, so he was throwing effectively in spring 2017 practices. Rosen had the performance of the year in the season's opening weekend, leading the Bruins in an amazing 45-44 comeback win with 491 passing yards and four touchdowns. He struggled over a four-game stretch at the start of the Pac-12 season, throwing eight of his 10 interceptions on the year. He did earn second-team All-Pac-12 notice, however, by completing 62.6 percent of his passes (283-452), throwing 26 touchdowns, and ranking second in the country with 341.5 passing yards a game (3,756 total).

He played in three games, starting two, led the team to a comeback win over rival Oklahoma. Rudolph was OSU's MVP in 2015, starting 12 games (missing most of that year's Bedlam due to injury), completing 62.3 percent of his passes for 3,770 yards and 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions. In his junior campaign, Rudolph stood tall in the pocket and earned honorable mention all-conference honors, distributing the ball to either sideline, as well as down the field, for 4,091 yards (ranking eighth in the FBS) on a 63.4 completion rate with 28 touchdowns -- but throwing just four interceptions in the process. While Rudolph is a pocket passer, he also had six rushing touchdowns in 2016. Rudolph finished his career by winning the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm and Sammy Baugh Awards while earning second-team All-Big 12 recognition.

He was named the Offensive MVP in the Independence Bowl win over Vanderbilt (six receptions, 104 yards, three TDs). Samuels started 10 of 13 games played for the second straight year in 2016, one year after winning All-American, first-team All-ACC, and Pack Offensive MVP honors by leading all tight ends nationally in receptions (65 receptions, 597 yards, seven TDs) and running for 368 yards and nine touchdowns on 56 attempts. In limited touches as a freshman, Samuels showed glimpses of his talent (15 rush, 143 yards, TD; six receptions, 96 yards, one TD). This versatility was not a surprise, as Samuels was the top prospect in North Carolina in high school after putting up 2,300 yards of total offense and 55 touchdowns as a senior.",

It didn't take long for his long legs and full extension to flip the field for Alabama. As a true freshman, Scott led the nation in gross punting average with 48 yards per kick, and placed 31-of-55 kicks inside the 20-yard-line while only allowing five touchbacks. He was a 2014 Ray Guy Award finalist, first-team All-SEC selection, and first-team Freshman All-American and All-American by numerous outlets. His average was down a bit in 2015 (44.2 gross), but he still put 25-of-70 kicks inside the 20-yard-line. Scott bounced back to average 47.2 yards a kick as a junior (ranking third in the FBS), placing 25-of-64 punts inside the 20 and garnering second-team All-American and first-team all-conference honors. Scott was a first-team All-SEC selection as a senior, averaging 43 yards per punt, forcing 27 fair catches on 54 punts while also putting 27 inside the 20 yard-line. Scott has kickoff experience, as well; he performed that duty 34 times in his first three seasons (12 touchbacks) and then all 99 in his final season (45 touchbacks). He's had two punts blocked in his career (one in 2015, one in the 2016 national title game).",

His mother is from Germany. He lived in France for a short time as a youth and went to a French school while living in California. But it was St. Brown's game that really got him noticed as a recruit, as he earned a top 100 overall prospect rankings after excelling his final two years (74 catches, 1,210 yards, 10 touchdowns) at Servite High School in Anaheim. Equanimeous (a form of equanimity, meaning to stay calm and cool under pressure) played in seven games as a freshman (one catch, eight receiving yards, blocked punt against USC), missing the final four with a shoulder injury. He and Deshone Kizer formed an alliance in 2016, however, allowing him to use his tall frame, huge catching radius, and long strides to lead the Irish with 58 receptions, 961 yards, and nine receiving touchdowns. Notre Dame's passing game went south with Brandon Winbush leading the offense, so St. Brown's statistics dropped (33 catches, 515 yards, four touchdowns). After his brother, Amon-Ra, decided to attend USC instead of UND as a five-star receiver recruit, Equanimeous' road to the NFL was paved.",

Scouts say he needs additional reps. Routes are rounded and lack a level of misdirection for defenders. Didn't have to run much of the route tree and will need time to learn it as a pro.

He played in every game as a true freshman, starting the final four games at corner (32 tackles, five pass breakups). Thomas ended the year on a high note, breaking up three passes and making four stops against Clemson in the Russell Athletic Bowl. Big 12 coaches named him second-team all-conference the next fall, starting 11 of 12 games played and posting 46 stops, five interceptions, and four pass breakups. Thomas achieved first-team all-league accolades as a junior full-time starter, tying for fourth nationally with 19 passes defensed. Two of those plays were interceptions, and he also had 46 tackles, two for loss, on the year. His game fell off a bit in 2017, however, making 27 tackles, two for loss, one interception, and two pass breakups in 12 games. Thomas started the first nine games of the year, then missed two games and played minimal snaps in three others due to a knee injury. Thomas has had some disciplinary issues during his college career. He was suspended for disciplinary reasons twice in 2015, for the first quarter of the season opener and for a full game two weeks later. In December 2015, Thomas was arrested for failing to appear in court for a traffic citation. Before the 2016 season, Thomas was arrested after running from the scene of a bar fight (he ran because of the night he spent in jail).  ",

Thomas was then suspended for the first six games of the 2014 campaign for violating team rules; he eventually got on the field in eight games, starting three (26 tackles, 2.5 for loss). His mother passed away in January 2015 from lung disease, and that, understandably, affected his school work; he was ruled academically ineligible for the 2015 season. But things turned around when Thomas returned to the field as a redshirt junior in 2016. He started 12 of 13 games played and led the team with 77 tackles, playing fast and strong with the length to wrap up ballcarriers at will. He had 11 tackles for loss, 3.5 of which came in FSU's Orange Bowl win over Michigan (Thomas had 11 total stops in the contest). Thomas led the Seminoles in tackles in 2017 with 85, 10 for loss, two sacks, an interception, two pass break-ups, and a blocked kick in 12 starts (he did not play in the Independence Bowl).",

Toth aided quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw and others racking up 362 yards a game on the ground. He was an all-state tight end from South Carolina when enrolling at West Point. Toth played in just one game as a reserve as a freshman, and started two of four games played in 2015 before becoming an integral part of the line. ",

        "strengths": "NFL-worthy size with thick hips and powerful upper body. Can be very intimidating at point of attack. Able to overpower lighter guards and usually pummels centers when isolated on them. Has power to press blockers off of his frame and the hip rotation and flexibility to dislodge them. Also utilizes booming hump move that can topple blockers off their base as a pass rush counter. Able to grow roots and own his grass when pad level is right. Two-gap defender. Can punch, lock out, and locate the ball. Above average pursuit quickness for a big man. Able to shed blockers and range to down the line of scrimmage to squeeze running lanes and make tackles. Violent hands can clear hands from his frame or soften the blocker's edge when he's rushing the passer. Has serious bull-rush ability once he gains momentum early in rush. Still very raw with much more talent to unlock.",

Despite playing in 10 games (all starts), Victor was voted first-team All-Pac-12 (67 tackles, three for loss) because of his willingness to chase any play or fill any hole with his strong presence. His aggression did get the best of him at times, like when he was suspended for the first half of the Oregon contest that year after being ejected for a targeting call against USC. His senior season did not end as expected, with a suspension after a DUI charge leading Victor starting just five times in nine games (30 tackles, two for loss, three pass breakups). Victor played well as a sophomore starter (11 of 13 games played), garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice with 95 stops, nine for loss, 1.5 sacks, an interception (returned for a touchdown) and six pass breakups. He made an impact on special teams early in his career, receiving the team's Special Teams Scout Squad MVP award during his 2013 redshirt season, and then playing in 10 games on coverage units -- making two of his five tackles for the year against Washington State in the Apple Cup.

Ward proved his coach correct, earning first-team All-American and all-conference accolades in 2017 with 37 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, and 15 pass breakups (ranked in the top 10 in the nation). He earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media as a non-starter in 2016, playing 30 snaps a game on defense. Ward tied Lattimore for the team lead with nine pass breakups on the year (23 tackles), never giving up on a play and being quite physical despite his average size for the position. Ward got onto the field as a true freshman, making seven tackles, primarily on special teams. Ward was a first-team All-Ohio pick and Division II Co-Defensive Player of the Year as a high school senior (nine interceptions, 18 pass breakups). He also qualified for the state track meet as a long jumper and part of the 4x400 relay.",

It's not as though he wasn't a ballyhooed recruit himself; Webb was an all-state pick from Michigan that was among the top 50 prospects in the 2014 draft class. Big Ten coaches underestimated his play last fall, only giving him honorable mention notice despite his 61 tackles, two for loss, team-high five interceptions, three pass breakups, and two fumble recoveries. Despite his talent, the Buckeyes' depth in the secondary kept him off the field in his first two years on the team. He played in eight games in the 2014 national title season (three tackles, one pass breakup, forced fumble) and seven games in 2015 (seven tackles) as the team's regular bevy of pro-caliber defensive backs kept him down the depth chart. Webb moved from corner to safety in the spring of 2016, however, opening up a door to a job where he could use his straight-line speed, coverage skills, and physical brand of play. He was voted honorable mention all-conference by Big Ten coaches as a junior, starting all 13 games, recording 57 tackles, two for loss, an interception, and three pass breakups.",

Wells' production dropped significantly in 2017 (9 catches, 133 yards, two touchdowns), but league coaches voted him second-team all-conference again because of his lack of receiving opportunities and his important role as a blocker for the nation's leading rusher, Rashaad Penny.",

He ate up Kansas' secondary for 160 yards and two touches on eight catches in the Jackrabbits' upset. Wieneke was a third-team AP All-American as a junior, accumulating 1,316 yards on 78 grabs while tying his SDSU record 16 scores.

Now his son is heading towards a pro career. Cedrick, Jr., was an All-State pick in Tennessee as a quarterback before heading to Coffeyville Community College for two seasons. He was All-Conference as a freshman there and an All-American as a sophomore with 66 catches for 1,045 yards and 17 touchdowns. Wilson didn't take long to fit in with the Broncos, earning honorable mention All-Mountain West honors as a receiver (56 receptions, 1,129 yards, led team with 11 touchdowns) while also contributing as a punt returner (10 returns, 132 yards, long of 73 yards) in his junior campaign. His senior season was even better, earning first-team All-Conference recognition by leading BSU with 83 receptions and 1,511 yards, scoring seven times. He presents the height, hands, body control, footwork, and open-field agility to succeed as a starter at the next level.",

Wynn began his sophomore year at the left guard spot, starting eight games there before moving over one spot to his left for the remaining five games. The transfer of Tyler Catalina from Western Carolina to Georgia forced Wynn to slide back to the left guard spot in 2016, where he started 12 times (missing one game due to injury). ",

You might even see a team draft him as a center since he's stronger than a lot of the centers you will see in this draft. - NFC area scout",
        "strengths": "Plays with fluidity of movement and desired knee bend throughout rep. Initial quickness is above average. Gets into blocks with tight footwork and runs feet through contact. Stays connected to his blocks and rarely falls off. Looks to finish. Effective as move blocker and base blocker. Takes good angles up to linebacker as backside blocker and has technique and athleticism to reach and secure blocks others may struggle with. Offers tackle-level pass technique if bumped inside. Has body control and balance and feet to handle counter rush moves. Extremely aware against twists and quick to respond. Plays with disciplined hand usage keeping them inside opponent's frame in both run and pass. Hands are very strong. Flashes necessary anchor. Has starting experience at both guard and tackle.",
        "weaknesses": "Is a little lean in his lowers with a high-cut frame. Built more like a tackle than a guard, but is packed into a 6-foot-2 frame. Will have to prove he can withstand NFL power. Could benefit from getting better arm extension into initial punch as interior blocker in NFL. May lack necessary pop in his hips to displace 1-gappers who are clogging running lanes. Will lose patience and chase on occasion rather than standing his ground and making defenders come to him.",

His man coverage skills need more work, but he has the talent to go from backup to starter within a couple of seasons.",

Positions himself on receiver's hip when pacing down the field. Good awareness from off coverage. From zone, recognizes bait routes and will peel off and respond to incoming receiver in his area. Has length and ball skills to tilt 50-50 balls in his favor. Willing striker. Drives hard into receiver looking to dislodge the catch. Steps up and puts in work as tackler when uncovered and challenged by running backs. Cover specialist on kickoffs and as a gunner on punt teams. Had 10 coverage tackles this year and 20 for his career.",
        "weaknesses": "Posts up with knock-kneed stance from press. Backpedal is tall and tight in off man coverage. Sluggish to open and sprint versus speed. Could face deep ball repercussions if he doesn't start his sprint early. Below average route mirroring giving up separation from breaks. Lacks smooth feet for easy recoveries when out of position. Route recognition can improve. Delays at the top when on plant and drive to throws. Inconsistent timing to play the ball leads him into early contact at times. Gets hung up by big blocking receivers against the run. Must learn to attack and discard more quickly.",

Then, during his sophomore season with the Bruins, he battled through the death of his grandmother and a cancer diagnosis for his father. Now, NFL scouts are giving him high marks for his on-field performance, especially after a first-team All-Pac-12 senior year where he led UCLA with 110 tackles, 8.5 for loss, one sack, and three passes deflected. Young had a strong junior season, as well, and coaches voted him second-team all-conference for his efforts. He started all 12 games in 2016, making 90 tackles, 8.5 for loss, with five sacks, three passes defensed, and three fumble recoveries. The previous year, Young started 12 of 13 games, posting 69 stops, five for loss, and two forced fumbles. He even started six games as a true freshman, playing all 13 contests and recording 35 stops. Young was a highly sought-after four-star recruit (ranked a top 10 linebacker prospect nationally) coming out of the New Orleans area.",

Fails to bring it to lead blockers and gives away his gap too easily. Below average taking on blocks. Coasts on second level and let's plays come to him. Has to learn to punch and separate or slip blocks to be a pro player. Needs to play the game downhill to avoid his deficiencies. More finesse than physical.

Punch slides right up and off the target. Doesn't get enough out of his length. Spin counter is bulky right now.",
