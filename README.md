# Project Description

The overall goal of this project is to collect National Football League (NFL) data from a variety of sources including:

NFL.com
NFL Reddit page
ESPN.com

The data should be continuously collected throughout a season (i.e. every week) and will be stored locally in CSV files in the DATA folder.

This data can then be used for a variety of analytical pursuits.
